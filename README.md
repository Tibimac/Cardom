# Cardom
Sample mini app 100% Swift in Clean Swift Architecture (VIP) without Storyboard.
Use MapKit to do a snapshot displayed in contact details.
Ability to init a call/email directly from contacts list if device is able to do it.

Details :
- Loads a "page" of 10 random contacts from `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10`
- Saves them in cache (in order to display them on next launch if network is unreacheable)
- Displays them (loads next "page" when scrolling, scroll is infinite)
